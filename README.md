# Amman Imman Field Training App

Amman Imman is a non-profit NGO that works in the Azawak region of Africa, in between Niger and Mali. This is a collaborative project that allows local field nurses and team members to train individuals on multiple health and sanitation practices that otherwise would not have been available to them. We used visual representations as a universal communicator.
